## INTRODUCTION

This project is a implementation of a Car Registration API in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).
It uses [Express](https://expressjs.com/) as web framework and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) as database.
The code is fully covered by tests, using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).

The application allows new users to register and authenticate by using [JSON Web Tokens](https://jwt.io/).


## INSTALLATION

In order to run the application on your local machine some requirements need to be installed.

#### Node.js

Install `npm` which is distributed with Node.js.

#### MongoDB

Install MongoDB and make sure the database server is running.

#### Dependencies

Change the directory to the project folder and install the dependencies.

```
npm install
```

## TESTS

Run the tests to make sure everything is installed correctly and working.

```
npm test
```

## USAGE

Finally, start the Node web server.

```
npm start
```

The easiest way to interact with the server is by installing a API development environment such as [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/).
